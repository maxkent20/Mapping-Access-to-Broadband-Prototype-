There are some interesting patterns that this analysis presents: 

Demographic relationships with the number of fixed broadband providers:
1. There is an observable negative relationship between the percentage of the population that is non-white(black or native american) and the number of fixed broadband providers that serve a specific block group. 
2. On the other hand, there is an observable positive relationship that as block groups become proportionally more white, the number of cable providers seems to increase. 
3. Block groups with a greater population of people who earn below 10k/year have fewer options as those with fewer people who make below 10k per year. 
4. These observations between race/income and broadband opportunity also translate to broadband access. In the list of top ten block groups with the fastest average upload and download speeds mostly consist of block groups with whiter populations and those with less poverty. 
5. However, many of the areas in which there is the most mobile broadband access tend to have a greater percentage of their population that is non-white and incomes below 10k. 
6. Similarly, many of the areas with the least amount of mobile broadband availability have the most fixed broadband opportunity. After looking at the GIS projections, these areas tend to be more rural areas furthest from Syracuse and other towns.
